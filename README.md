## Current Progress — ~35%

Weeks 1–2 of the 4-week plan are largely done on the **backend foundation** side.
Auth, org/team management, project management, and the recording upload path are live.
Meeting infrastructure (WebRTC signaling, transcription, AI summaries) is the
remaining bulk of the work.

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monorepo + tooling | ✅ | pnpm workspaces, TypeScript, ESLint, dev/build scripts |
| API server core | ✅ | Express, helmet, CORS, cookie parser, 16 kb body limit, Swagger UI at `/api/docs` |
| Response/error layer | ✅ | `ApiResponse`, `ApiError`, `notFoundHandler`, `errorHandler`, `asyncHandler` |
| Auth (F01) | ✅ | Register, login, refresh, logout, `/auth/me`; JWT + bcrypt, httpOnly refresh cookie |
| Organizations / teams (F06) | ✅ | Org details, member list, invite-code verify & regenerate |
| Projects (F06) | ✅ | CRUD, project members, role update, remove member |
| Socket.io bootstrap | 🟡 | Typed Socket.io server attached; only connect/disconnect handled |
| WebRTC video meetings (F02) | ⬜ | No signaling or peer logic yet |
| Screen recording capture | ✅ | Browser capture contract measured and documented ([client/docs/SCREEN_RECORDING_CAPTURE.md](./client/docs/SCREEN_RECORDING_CAPTURE.md)) |
| Recording upload + storage (F08) | ✅ | Org-scoped recording API, browser uploads direct to S3-compatible storage via presigned URLs; metadata in MongoDB only ([client/docs/SCREEN_RECORDING_CAPTURE.md](./client/docs/SCREEN_RECORDING_CAPTURE.md)) |
| Transcription / AI summary (F03) | ⬜ | `runPostProcessing` seam is in place; no STT provider selected yet |
| In-meeting chat (F04) | ⬜ | Page shell only |
| AI intelligence (F03) | ⬜ | Transcription, summary, action items not started |
| Post-meeting dashboard (F05) | 🟡 | UI page exists, no recordings/summaries data |
| Analytics (F07) | ⬜ | Not started |
| Docker / CI-CD | 🟡 | Multi-stage Dockerfiles, Compose stacks and file-based secrets done; CI/CD pipeline pending |

## Next Up
1. Meeting model + CRUD and WebRTC signaling over the existing Socket.io server
2. Real-time chat and in-meeting presence
3. AI transcription → summary → action item pipeline
4. Persist meetings/tasks behind the existing Meetings and Tasks pages (currently local state)
5. Kubernetes manifests/Helm chart and a GitHub Actions CI pipeline on top of the Docker setup
6. Prometheus/Grafana/Sentry observability

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev            # server + client together
pnpm dev:server     # API only
pnpm dev:client     # web client only
pnpm build
pnpm lint
pnpm openapi        # dump OpenAPI spec
```

Environment configuration lives in `server/src/config/env.ts` (see `.env.example`).

---

## Docker

```bash
pnpm secrets:generate   # writes server/secrets/*.txt (git-ignored)
pnpm docker:up          # builds and starts client + server + mongo
pnpm docker:logs
pnpm docker:down

pnpm docker:tools       # also starts mongo-express (8081) and the S3 emulator (4566)
```

| URL | Service |
| --- | --- |
| http://localhost:3000 | Web client (nginx, proxies `/api` to the server) |
| http://localhost:5000 | API + Swagger UI (`/api/docs`) |
| http://localhost:8081 | MongoDB UI (optional profile) |

**Images**
- `server/Dockerfile` — build TypeScript, then run `dist/server.js` on Node 22 Alpine as a non-root user with a healthcheck on `/api/v1/health`
- `client/Dockerfile` — build the Vite bundle, serve it from `nginx:alpine` with SPA fallback, immutable asset caching and a WebSocket-capable `/api` reverse proxy

**Compose files**
- `docker-compose.yml` (root) — full stack: client, server, MongoDB, plus optional `tools` profile
- `server/docker-compose.yml` — server + MongoDB only

**Secrets**
Credentials are never passed as plain environment values and never baked into an
image. Compose mounts them as read-only files under `/run/secrets`, and
`server/src/config/env.ts` reads each value from `<NAME>_FILE` first, then falls
back to `<NAME>`. There are **no default secret values in code** — a missing
`MONGO_URI`, `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, or `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` stops the server with a
clear error instead of running on a known key. See `server/secrets/README.md`.

**Build config**
`VITE_API_BASE_URL` is a public build-time variable, not a secret. Compose defaults
it to `/api/v1` so the client calls the nginx proxy on its own origin; override it
in `.env` when the API lives on a different host.
